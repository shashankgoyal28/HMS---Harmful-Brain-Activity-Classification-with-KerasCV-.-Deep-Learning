# HMS---Harmful-Brain-Activity-Classification-with-KerasCV-.-Deep-Learning
This notebook guides you through the process of training and inferring a Deep Learning model, specifically EfficientNetV2,resnet50_v2_imagenet,mobilenet_v3_large_imagenet,densenet201_imagenet, using KerasCV on the competition dataset. Specificaclly, this notebook uses spectrogram of the eeg data to classify the patterns.
